In this work we present BOTS-LM, a series of bilingual language models proficient in both Setswana and English. Leveraging recent advancements in data availability and efficient fine-tuning, BOTS-LM achieves performance similar to models significantly larger than itself while maintaining computational efficiency. Our initial release features an 8 billion parameter generative large language model, with upcoming 0.5 billion and 1 billion parameter large language models and a 278 million parameter encoder-only model soon to be released. We find the 8 billion parameter model significantly outperforms Llama-3-70B and Aya 23 on English-Setswana translation tasks, approaching the performance of dedicated machine translation models, while approaching 70B parameter performance on Setswana reasoning as measured by a machine translated subset of the MMLU benchmark. To accompany the BOTS-LM series of language models, we release the largest Setswana web dataset, SetsText, totalling over 267 million tokens. In addition, we release the largest machine translated Setswana dataset, the first and largest synthetic Setswana dataset, training and evaluation code, training logs, and MMLU-tsn, a machine translated subset of MMLU.
