In high school I developed what is to the knowledge of myself, my professors, and my peers, a new method for estimating the circumference of an ellipse through the exact calculation of the perimeter of horizontally and vertically stretched regular polygons. By increasing the number of sides of this polygon to approach infinity, a highly accurate approximation of the circumference of the circumscribed ellipse and subsequently π. This work was done as part of an informal internship with a local STEM leadership academy. I am working to revise this methodology and make it public. If you or anyone you know are interestedd in this, please reach out to me via e-mail.
