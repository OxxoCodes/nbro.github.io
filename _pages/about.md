About Me
======
I am a undergraduate student at Clemson University pursuing both my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with a minor in Cybersecurity, and a Master's in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science and Informatics.

I have over ten years of self-led experience with software development, have worked with companies such as Microsoft, Giant Oak, and Ally Financial, and have professional experience in a variety of fields. Over the past year and a half I have become quite active in artificial intelligence and machine learning research, with [my first publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13657) being accepted to [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/). I'm very interested in continuing to partake in research, and am currently working on developing my own (small) LLM based on Microsoft's [RetNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621).
