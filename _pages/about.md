I am a undergraduate student at Clemson University pursuing both my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with a minor in Cybersecurity, and a Master's in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science and Informatics.

I have over a decade of self-led experience with software development, have worked with companies such as Microsoft, Giant Oak, and Ally Financial, and have professional experience in a variety of fields including full-stack development, cybersecurity. Over the past year and a half I have become quite active in artificial intelligence and machine learning research, with [my first publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13657) being accepted to [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/). I'm very interested in continuing to partake in research, and am currently working on developing my own (small) LLM based on Microsoft's [RetNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621).

In the meantime, I'm also codirector of [CUhackit](https://cuhack.it/#), Clemson University's official student hackathon organization, the only hackathon organization in South Carolina recognized by [MLH](https://mlh.io/), and home of the largest hackathon in South Carolina! We do a lot of interesting work and help get many future engineers their first start, so if you or your organization are interested in working with us don't hesitate to reach out!
